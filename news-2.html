					<h2>Champions League: What have we learned from group stage?</h2>
					<p class="description">"The highest-scoring Champions League group stages ever have come to an end with the usual suspects qualifying - but there are some unfamiliar names among the top goalscorers."</p>
					<p>For each of the past 12 seasons Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi has won the Champions League golden boot - including one year they shared it with Neymar. Messi had four in a row, before Ronaldo's six in a row (including their shared season) before Messi won it again last season.</p>
					<p>There has been one man dominating the scoring charts with them for the past eight seasons - but he has yet to win a golden boot - or the Champions League.</p>
					<p>Could this be Robert Lewandowski's season? Since the start of 2011-12 the Pole has scored 62 goals - only one fewer than Messi. Ronaldo is the only other player to score more, with 90 goals in his last 88 Champions League games.</p>
					<p>The three are in a league of their own. The next top goalscorer is Karim Benzema on 38.</p>
					<p>This season Lewandowski has scored 10 Champions League goals in five games (he was an unused substitute in the final match against Tottenham), an average of one every 44 minutes. That puts him two above Erling Braut Haaland (more on him soon) with Harry Kane next on six.</p>
					<p>Rarely has a Champions League goal machine come from nowhere as much as Haaland this season. The 19-year-old, who plays for unheralded Red Bull Salzburg, scored a remarkable eight goals in the first five Champions League games of his career.</p>
					<p>Even though Salzburg are out in the group stages, that would be enough to see him finish as the third top scorer in the tournament more often than not.</p>
					<p>In fact his eight goals would have been enough to win or share the Champions League Golden Boot in nine different seasons - mostly before Ronaldo and Messi's 12-year stranglehold on the crown.</p>
