					<h2>Championship Derby knock Crystal Palace out of FA Cup</h2>
					<p class="description">"Derby County boss Phillip Cocu claimed Wayne Rooney played a pivotal role in his side's shock FA Cup third-round win at Crystal Palace."</p>
					<p>Chris Martin's close-range strike gave the Championship side victory at Selhurst Park as Palace had captain Luka Milivojevic sent off.</p>
					<p>Rooney was highly influential in the tie from a deep-lying midfield role.</p>
					<p>"Rooney influenced the game a lot because you could see his experience," Cocu said of the ex-England captain.</p>
					<p>"I think he did very good; he played a more controlled position.</p>
					<p>"A big part of the success today is the combination between him and Tom Huddlestone - it was a pleasure to watch."</p>
					<p>The Rams weathered some early Palace pressure and seized the advantage with the opening goal from Martin just after the half-hour mark.</p>
					<p>Jayden Bogle's quick feet took him past Palace full-back Jairo Riedewald, and his cross was met by Martin, who stole in front of Gary Cahill and poked the ball past goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.</p>
					<p>A deflected effort from Palace midfielder James McCarthy brought a smart reaction save out of Derby goalkeeper Kelle Roos shortly after half-time, while Bogle headed wide from a glorious position for Derby shortly after.</p>
					<p>Milivojevic was dismissed after referee Michael Oliver consulted a pitchside monitor following a video assistant referee (VAR) check.</p>
					<p>Derby could have added a second late on when Martyn Waghorn struck the post and Rooney then saw a low effort saved by Hennessey.</p>
