					<h2>January transfer window 2020: Who could be on the move?</h2>
					<p class="description">"It's that time of the season again."</p>
					<p>Clubs will be on the hunt for a bargain or big-money signing, whether they are aiming for the title, looking to clinch a European spot or trying to avoid relegation.</p>
					<p>There is one interesting point to consider this season - players who have played for one team in Europe are no longer cup-tied when they move to another club participating in European competition.</p>
					<p>So could that mean clubs are more willing to splash the cash?</p>
					<p>London-based investment company Carteret Analytics advises three Premier League clubs, and another 12 leading sides from around Europe and the rest of the world, on potential new signings.</p>
					<p>Its data centres on the 'intrinsic value' of a player - a fee calculated by assessing their performances for the selling club and the projected impact on the buying club, as well as taking into consideration their prime age (usually 26-30).</p>
					<p>The company has provided data for some of the names on BBC Sport's list of players who could move in January.</p>
